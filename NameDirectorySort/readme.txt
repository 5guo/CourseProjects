NameDirectory (Ge2 part II)	

	Purpose: To better understand the use of file i/o streams, command-line arguments, various
		levels of pointers and pointer indirection, and dynamic memory allocation, and text parsing.
		
	Program: This program reads in a list of names and sorts them in ascending or descending order.

		Input File Format:  [Number of entries]				2
							LastName, FirstName				Smith, John J.
							...		, ...					Adams, Susan Ann
	
	Procedure:
		Read, process, and save command-line arguments.
		
		Read number of data items from file.
		
		Dynamically allocate an array of pointers on the heap, each element containing
		the address of a dynamically allocated string object.
		
		Loop through data in file:
			Read in data
			Copy to temp string
			Copy temp string to dynamically allocated string pointer.
			Place string pointer address in array of pointers.
		End loop
		
		Sort array of pointers so that the names in the dynamically allocated strings
			are in ASCENDING or DESCENDING order, as per user's command-line argument.
			
		Output results.
		
		Free dynamically allocated memory.
		
	Command-line Usage: NameDirectory {asc | desc} < InputFile.txt > OutputFile.txt
	
	Batch-File Usage: NameDirectory.exe can be from command-line only due to required
		command-line arguments. Furthurmore, the program is meant to write specifically 
		formatted data to a new file through indirection operators (as per program requirements), 
		so that an output file may also be used as an input file. Thus, outputting 
		characters to the console was prohibited. Using a batch-file to run the program 
		gives the user more information about the processing, but doesn't interfer with
		the programs use of indirection operators.
	
		NameDirectoryAscending.bat
			Display file data before and after sort; creates a new file with data
			sorted in ascending order.
		NameDirectoryDescending.bat
			Display file data before and after sort; creates a new file with data
			sorted in descending order.
