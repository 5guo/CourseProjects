Search Benchmarks (GE2)

    Usage: SearchBenchmarks

    Program takes no arguments.

    Purpose: The purpose of this program is consolidate knowledge of functions 
        and their parameters, arguments, reference and value arguments, by 
        working with different search algorithms and analyzing the results.
    
    Program: This program compares the efficiency in maximum, minimum, and average
        comparisons needed to find an index-key in an array of 1000 elements.
    
    Procedure:
    For detailed program specifications, see GE1.pdf
    
        An array of 1000 elements is populated with random numbers ranging from 
        0 to 9999.
        
        Linear (sequential) search is performed on the array to find a random 
        (0-9999) number.
        
        Array is sorted using selection sort in ascending order.
        
        Binary search is performed on the array to find a random (0-9999) number.
        
        Results are aggregated and displayed.
